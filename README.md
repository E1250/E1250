## I am Islam Ahmed, an Artificial Intelligence Engineer and a lover of programming since childhood
I did many projects in the mobile application industry using Kotlin and Flutter, and then I studied Data Science, and then I delved into artificial intelligence while continuing with these previous tools until now.
